## Notice

This isn't an officially sanctioned app, and NES or their data provider might revoke or block this access. Though it's just using public data, so I don't see why they would.

## Why?

During outages, the NES outage map shows affected areas but doesn't clearly indicate whether a technician has been assigned to your specific outage. This tool monitors your outage event and alerts you when the status changes from "Unassigned" to "Assigned" (or any other status), so you know help is on the way.

## Features

- Real-time status monitoring with auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Color-coded status display:
  - **Red**: Unassigned (no technician dispatched yet)
  - **Flashing Green**: Assigned (technician en route!)
- Shows outage details: affected customers, start time, last update, cause (if known)
- Manual refresh with `r` key
- Quit with `q` or `Esc`

## Finding Your Event ID

1. Go to [nespower.com/outages](https://www.nespower.com/outages/)
2. Open your browsers Dev Tools
3. Click on your outage marker on the map
4. Get event id.
